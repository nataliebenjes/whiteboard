//Problem 1
// Write a recursive function that reverses the order of words in a sentence. For instance, "I am a cat" should become "cat a am I".

// What is recusion?
// another way of writing a loop

const input = "I am a cat"
split at " "

const reversePhrase = (word) => {
  //base case goes here
  

}
